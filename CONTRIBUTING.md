## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

If you find a bug or encounter an issue, please report it by following these steps:

1. **Check for existing issues**: Before creating a new issue, check if the problem has already been reported.
2. **Provide a clear description**: When opening a new issue, provide a detailed description of the problem, steps to reproduce, and any relevant screenshots or logs.
3. **Use the appropriate labels**: Label your issue with relevant tags (e.g., bug, enhancement, question).

### Contributing Code

To contribute code to the project, please follow these steps:

1. **Fork the repository**: Click the "Fork" button at the top of the repository page to create your own copy of the project.
2. **Clone your fork**: Clone the forked repository to your local machine.
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PumukyDev/web-server.git
   ```

3. **Create a new branch**: It's important to create a new branch for your work, rather than committing directly to the main branch.

   ```bash
    git checkout -b my-feature-branch
   ```

4. **Make your changes**: Implement your feature or bug fix. Be sure to write clear and concise commit messages. If applicable, write tests for your changes.
5. **Test your changes**: Make sure everything works as expected before submitting.
6. **Push your changes**: After making your changes, push them to your fork on GitHub.

   ```bash
    git push origin my-feature-branch
   ```

7. **Create a pull request**: Go to the repository page and open a pull request to the main branch. Be sure to describe what your changes do and why they're needed.

### Style Guide

To maintain consistency in the codebase, please follow these guidelines:

* **Code formatting**: Ensure that your code follows the project's style conventions. You can check existing code for reference.

* **Commit messages**: Use clear and descriptive commit messages. A good format is:

    ```
    <type>: <short description>
    <longer explanation if necessary>
    ```

Example:

    ```
    fix: resolve broken link in the status page
    ```

Types of commits:

* feat: A new feature
* fix: A bug fix
* docs: Documentation changes
* chore: Miscellaneous changes (e.g., refactoring, dependencies)

### Translations

I'd love to make this project available in multiple languages! If you'd like to help translate the web interface:

1. Go to the translations section of the project.
2. Create a new translation file or edit the existing one.
3. Submit a pull request with your translation.

### Testing

Please make sure your changes are covered by tests, if applicable. If you are unsure, you can add a test for the changes you've made.
